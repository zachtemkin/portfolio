### Brief

Build a white-labeled mobile-web experience which alerts customers to newly issued insurance claim payments, and gives them a variety of digital and traditional options for receiving their payments. Specifically, leverage Visa Direct and Visa Digital Issuance as options to enable instant payouts.

Consumers get a more delightful experience during a potentially stressful time, insurance companies create more stickiness with their customers by providing a better experience and Visa sees more transaction volume over Visa Direct rails.

### Team & Timeline

I worked with an engineer and PM over two weeks to go from concept to functional prototype. The prototype was used as the basis for building a white-labeled app that was sold to clients.

## Early Mocks

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Because this project was so fast-paced, I didn't do much scketching, and instead jumped straight into Figma. Below are some early explorations that I evolved over the course of the sprint.

### Payment Method Selection

I initially explored a list view for the payment selection screen, but using a carousel of cards allowed for more information to be presented to the user. It also helps returning users distinguish between choosing a type of payment to set up from a specific payment method, once set-up.

## Final Delivery

### Scenario

Alex, a customer of Insurance Co. has two claim payouts available.
She has never claimed a payout before, and so is a new user to the payouts platform.

She will need to log-in, and set up at least one new payment method in order to get her money.

In this scenario, Alex sets up a virtual card to collect her first payment, and then decides to use an instant bank transfer to collect her second payment.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

#### Notification

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Alex receives an email from Insurance Co. telling her that her claims have been approved and she has 2 payouts available.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='8' offset='4' color='#117ACB'>

#### Onboarding

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

As a new user to the payouts platform, once she logs in, Alex gets some information about this new part of the Insurance Co. site, and what she is about to do.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

#### Home Screen

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

On the main screen, Alex first sees a card with another brief explanation of what she needs to do to get her money. Below that is a prominent call-to-action to set up a new payment method, and below that are the details of the payments available to her. If she tapped “collect” on the payment card at this point, it would taker her to the same place as tapping “Set Up Payment Method”

</MdxLayout>

#### New Payment Method Selection

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

When Alex taps the “Set Up Payment Method” button, she is brought to the view below, where she can choose the way she’d like to receive her money, and begin the set up process.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

![](./pop-screen_8.png)

![](./pop-screen_9.png)

![](./pop-screen_10.png)

</MdxScreenContainer>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

She has five options available to her:

- get her money on an instantly issued virtual pre-paid card
- instantly transfer funds to a debit card
- instantly link a bank account to transfer funds to
- use routing and account numbers to initiate an ACH transfer to a bank account
- request a mailed check

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

#### Set-Up First Payment Method

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Alex chooses the first option, virtual card. She first sees a screen outlining the steps to set up this option.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

![](./pop-screen_11.png)

</MdxScreenContainer>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Next, she confirms her personal information on file with Insurance Co., and proceeds to issue a new virtual card.

Once issued, she sees a representation of her new card, a check-box indicating that this can be made her default payment method, and the ability to add the card to the digital wallet on her phone.

If she taps “done” she gets a final screen reminding her of what she's just done.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

#### Claim first payout

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Now that Alex has set up a payment method, she is brought to this screen where her first claim payout is displayed with the new virtual card applied to it. She can now collect the money for this claim on the virtual card.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

#### Claim next payout & change payment method

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Because Alex has more than one payout available, she is prompted to claim her next payout after successfully claiming the first.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

![](./pop-screen_18.png)

![](./pop-screen_19.png)

![](./pop-screen_20.png)

</MdxScreenContainer>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

By default, the last payment method she set up – the virtual card – is applied to this payout. However, by tapping the pill showing the payment method, she exposes a bottom drawer containing the list of her existing payment methods, as well as a button to add a new payment method.

She chooses to tap this button, and is brought back to the carousel, where she now chooses to set up an Instant Bank Transfer.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

![](./pop-screen_22.png)

![](./pop-screen_21.png)

</MdxScreenContainer>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

After linking her account, she is brought back to the payout screen with this payment method now applied. She claims the payment and returns home.

</MdxLayout>

<MdxScreenContainer col='10' offset='2' color='#117ACB'>

![](./pop-screen_25.png)

![](./pop-screen_26.png)

![](./pop-screen_27.png)

</MdxScreenContainer>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

From the home screen she can view her payment history and manage the different payment methods she’s set up.

</MdxLayout>

### Early Results

This work was instrumental in gaining support for this concept with leadership at Visa. The designs were showcased to prospective insurance clients at the Money 2020 conference which lead to several further client engagements.

## Conclusion

</MdxLayout>

<MdxLayout col='8' offset='4'>

Overall, I found this project to be fun and challenging practice in rapid iteration and concepting. On principle, this project was exciting because it’s a great example of taking something typically seen as a utility and turning it into an experience that has clear benefit for the end-user.

If I were to continue working on this, I’d like to explore both a native mobile app version and a desktop web version. I'd also like to look into accessibility more deeply by testing with keyboard-only users, or low-sighted users to continue to refine the designs.

I’d also explore refining and documenting design patterns systematically, so that as the team had a consistent and evolving pattern-set to draw on for new features.

From a product perspective there are other interesting challenges to consider moving forward. This product is intended to be offered to different types of insurance companies who’s customers may have slightly different needs. It would be interesting to explore how this offering could be made configurable for different insurance companies and explore how the experience could vary to support different end-user needs, while maintaining the same general component parts.
