### Brief

I was tasked to design a white-labeled experience to envision a new type of payment product, the [Flex Credential](https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2024/05/14/one-card-to-1715696707658.html) to use to sell the product to issuers. Ultimately I helped shaped elements of this new product and created assets that were instrumental in bringing this concept to fruition with key clients.
