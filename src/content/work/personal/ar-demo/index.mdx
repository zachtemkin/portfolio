    As part of the NY Innovation Studio tour, we talk about omni-channel retail, and show how merchants are bridging online and offline channels. One trend I was interested in exploring was the use of AR to help customers demo items before they buy them. This can be done from their home or in store in the case of items that may not be in stock.

I had just watched WWDC where Apple announced support for viewing .usdz files in AR natively. I took this as an opportunity to create a quick and easy to implement AR retail experience.

I molded a Sonos speaker in blender and rendered it out as a .usdz file with several different materials in different colors. I built a simple website to host these files, and because of the native iOS support, these items could then be viewed in AR.

We used this demo on the tour for the next year, and clients were always surprised and delighted by the ‘magic’ of AR.
