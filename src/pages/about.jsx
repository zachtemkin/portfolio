            I'm a designer with a knack for coding and a deep understanding of
            business practices. Currently on the Digital Partnerships &amp;
            Fintech team at Visa, I work to bring new Visa-powered payment
            experiences to life for existing and potential clients, and to help
            define Visaâ€™s strategic vision for digital experiences in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my role, I work with stakeholders across Visa's senior
            leadership, as well as with clients, and partners to deliver designs
            and prototypes for clear and delightful experiences that address
            complex user needs.
