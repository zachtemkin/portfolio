          I'm a designer with a knack for coding and a deep understanding of
          business practices. Currently on the Digital Partnerships &amp;
          Fintech team at Visa, I work to bring new Visa-powered payment
          experiences to life for existing and potential clients, and to help
          define Visaâ€™s strategic vision for digital experiences in the future.

          In my role, I work with stakeholders across Visa's senior leadership,
          as well as with clients, and partners to deliver designs and
          prototypes for clear and delightful experiences that address complex
          user needs.
